# Shortest path generator

Try the application at https://shortest-path-generator.herokuapp.com/ with data available from the Turku region.

This application uses data provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to create a graph of roads which are suitable for walking. The graph is then used to find the shortest walking path between coordinate points by using self-implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and Fibonacci heap.
